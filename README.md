DnD-weapon-comparison
=====================

This is a fun little project created to compare two weapons together over a range of enemy armor classes, uploaded here to be tracked and eventually shared with family on ShinyApps.io.

Both the project code and the file containing calculations and functions are included. Note that ALL of these elements are required, as the shiny app is built off of the calculations file. This was done to make editing graphing and calculations easier, if necessary.
